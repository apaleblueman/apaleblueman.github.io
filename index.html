    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <ul>
    <li><p>The origin of the phrase ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù dates back to the early days of computer programming. It is often attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan">Brian Kernighan</a>, a computer scientist who co-authored the book ‚ÄúThe C Programming Language.‚Äù In this book, Kernighan included a small program that printed the words ‚Äúhello, world‚Äù on the screen using the C programming language.</p></li>

    <li><p>However, it is worth noting that the concept of displaying a greeting message on a computer screen existed long before Kernighan‚Äôs book. In fact, similar examples can be found in programming textbooks as early as the 1970s.</p></li>
    
    <li><p>One such example is the ‚ÄúAloha‚Äù program developed by University of Hawaii computer science professor, Ira W. Cotton. The program, written in the programming language PL/I, displayed the message ‚ÄúAloha, World!‚Äù on the screen. This early example of a greeting program laid the foundation for the ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù tradition that followed.</p></li>
